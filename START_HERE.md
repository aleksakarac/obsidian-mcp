# START HERE: Complete Guide to Get API Tools Working

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** ‚úÖ All fixes implemented, ready for final testing

---

## TL;DR - Quick Start

**Close Claude CLI, then run:**

```bash
/home/aleksa/start-claude-with-obsidian.sh
```

This script ensures environment variables are set before starting Claude CLI.

---

## What's Been Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. Error Handling
- **Before:** `'str' object has no attribute 'message'` (cryptic Python error)
- **After:** Clear, helpful error messages with setup instructions

### ‚úÖ 2. Security
- **Old API key (compromised):** `2fb876d...` ‚Üí Invalidated
- **New API key (secure):** `e16ee5b...` ‚Üí Active and working

### ‚úÖ 3. Clean Installation
- Fresh install following official README
- All dependencies up to date
- 63 tools available

### ‚úÖ 4. Filesystem Tools
- 98% success rate (49/50 operations)
- Tag management, link analysis, tasks, Kanban, etc. all working

### ‚è≥ 5. API Tools (Waiting for Environment Variables)
- Configuration is correct
- API is working (curl test successful)
- **Issue:** Claude CLI not passing environment variables to MCP server

---

## The Problem

Claude CLI's `env` section in `claude_desktop_config.json` **does not reliably pass environment variables** to MCP server subprocesses.

**We tried:**
1. Official README config ‚ùå
2. Wrapper scripts ‚ùå
3. Clean installation ‚ùå
4. Multiple restarts ‚ùå
5. Adding to ~/.bashrc ‚è≥ (needs proper shell loading)

**Solution:** Use a startup script that explicitly sets environment variables before starting Claude CLI.

---

## The Solution: Startup Script

### Option 1: Use the Startup Script (Recommended)

**File created:** `/home/aleksa/start-claude-with-obsidian.sh`

**How to use:**

```bash
# From any directory, run:
/home/aleksa/start-claude-with-obsidian.sh

# Or create an alias in your ~/.bashrc:
alias claude-obsidian='/home/aleksa/start-claude-with-obsidian.sh'

# Then just run:
claude-obsidian
```

**What it does:**
1. Sets `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`, `OBSIDIAN_API_URL`, `OBSIDIAN_REST_API_KEY`
2. Shows you what's set (for verification)
3. Starts Claude CLI with those environment variables
4. MCP server subprocess inherits them

---

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start Claude CLI with the Script

```bash
/home/aleksa/start-claude-with-obsidian.sh
```

You should see:
```
üîß Environment variables set:
  OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=/home/aleksa/Obsidian/
  OBSIDIAN_API_URL=https://127.0.0.1:27124
  OBSIDIAN_REST_API_KEY=e16ee5b5...

üöÄ Starting Claude CLI...
```

### 2. Verify MCP Server Loads

In Claude CLI, type: `/mcp`

**Expected:**
```
Obsidian MCP Server
Status: ‚úî connected
Tools: 63 tools
```

### 3. Test Filesystem Tool

```
Use vault_statistics_fs_tool to get stats for my vault
```

**Expected:** Statistics for ~44 notes

### 4. Test API Tool (The Critical Test!)

```
Use create_note_tool to create 'Victory.md' with content '# Success!\n\nAPI tools are finally working!'
```

**Expected Result:**
```
‚úÖ Note created successfully!
‚úÖ Path: /home/aleksa/Obsidian/Victory.md
```

---

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Debug Step 1: Check What Claude CLI Sees

In Claude CLI, ask:
```
What are the values of OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH, OBSIDIAN_API_URL, and OBSIDIAN_REST_API_KEY environment variables?
```

**If they're NOT set or empty:**
- The startup script didn't work
- Try Option 2 below

### Debug Step 2: Check What MCP Server Sees

In Claude CLI, ask:
```
Use the Bash tool to run: echo $OBSIDIAN_REST_API_KEY
```

**If it's NOT set or empty:**
- Claude CLI has the vars but isn't passing them to subprocesses
- This is a Claude CLI bug
- Try Option 3 below

---

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 2: Manual Export Before Each Session

```bash
# Before starting Claude CLI, run:
export OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH="/home/aleksa/Obsidian/"
export OBSIDIAN_API_URL="https://127.0.0.1:27124"
export OBSIDIAN_REST_API_KEY="e16ee5b59a739c4f1800b1ddcf6084ed72601170bd2eeedb8b060898dbf7c980"

# Verify:
echo $OBSIDIAN_REST_API_KEY

# Then start:
claude
```

### Option 3: Hardcode in Python (Last Resort)

If environment variables absolutely won't work, we can modify the MCP server to use hardcoded values for your local setup:

**File:** `src/utils/obsidian_api_client.py`

Change line 25 from:
```python
self.base_url = os.getenv("OBSIDIAN_API_URL", "http://localhost:27124")
```

To:
```python
self.base_url = os.getenv("OBSIDIAN_API_URL", "https://127.0.0.1:27124")
```

And line 26 from:
```python
self.api_key = os.getenv("OBSIDIAN_REST_API_KEY", "")
```

To:
```python
self.api_key = os.getenv("OBSIDIAN_REST_API_KEY", "e16ee5b59a739c4f1800b1ddcf6084ed72601170bd2eeedb8b060898dbf7c980")
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This is not recommended for security reasons, but will guarantee the values are available.

2. ‚úÖ See 63 MCP tools available
3. ‚úÖ Use filesystem tools (vault stats, tags, links, tasks, etc.)
4. ‚úÖ **Use API tools (create notes, execute commands, etc.)**

## Next Action

**Close Claude CLI and run:**

```bash
/home/aleksa/start-claude-with-obsidian.sh
```

Then test creating a note with `create_note_tool`.

If it works: üéâ **SUCCESS!**

If not: Check the debug steps above and report back what you see.

---

**This should be the final solution!** The startup script guarantees environment variables are set before Claude CLI starts, which should solve the issue once and for all.
