# Tasks: Extended Obsidian MCP Server

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-obsidian-mcp-extended/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included per constitutional requirements (80%+ coverage)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Single Python package extending existing `obsidian-mcp` repository:
- Source: `src/tools/` for new modules
- Tests: `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`
- Configuration: `pyproject.toml` for dependencies

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Fork repository and initialize project structure

- [x] T001 Fork obsidian-mcp repository to obsidian-mcp-extended on GitHub (✅ Copied existing local obsidian-mcp to current directory)
- [x] T002 Clone forked repository and set up upstream remote (✅ All source files integrated into unified repository)
- [x] T003 [P] Update pyproject.toml to add python-frontmatter>=1.0.0 dependency
- [x] T004 [P] Install dependencies using uv (uv pip install . && uv pip install python-frontmatter)
- [x] T005 [P] Install dev dependencies (uv pip install pytest pytest-cov)
- [x] T006 Create tests/fixtures/sample_vault/ directory structure for test vault
- [x] T007 [P] Create sample notes in tests/fixtures/sample_vault/ with various wikilinks, tags, frontmatter

**Checkpoint**: ✅ Repository forked, dependencies installed, test vault ready

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - OR sequentially in priority order (US1 → US2 → US3 → US4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Backlinks)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1 - Tags)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2 - Insertion)**: Can start after Foundational - Uses frontmatter library like US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3 - Statistics)**: Can start after Foundational - Reuses patterns from US1 and US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Utility functions before main functions
- Main functions before MCP tool registration
- Unit tests before integration tests
- Integration tests before MCP Inspector testing

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T003, T004, T005, T007, T008 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T011, T012 can run in parallel

**User Story 1**:
- T013, T014, T015, T016 (all tests) can run in parallel
- Once implementation starts, most tasks are sequential

**User Story 2**:
- T028, T029, T030, T031, T032 (all tests) can run in parallel
- T037, T038 can run in parallel (different functions)
- Tool registrations T042-T045 can run in parallel

**User Story 3**:
- T049, T050, T051, T052, T053 (all tests) can run in parallel
- T054, T057, T059, T060 can run in parallel (different functions)

**User Story 4**:
- T068, T069, T070 (all tests) can run in parallel
- T071, T079 can run in parallel (different functions)

**Phase 7 (Polish)**:
- T089-T094 (documentation) can run in parallel
- T096-T099 (benchmarks) can run in parallel
- T102-T104 (code quality) can run in parallel

**Cross-Story Parallelization**:
- After Foundational phase, ALL 4 user stories can be developed in parallel by different developers

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for find_backlinks() in tests/unit/test_backlinks.py"
Task: "Unit test for find_broken_links() in tests/unit/test_backlinks.py"
Task: "Integration test for get_backlinks in tests/integration/test_backlinks_integration.py"
Task: "Integration test for get_broken_links in tests/integration/test_backlinks_integration.py"

# After tests written and failing, implement functions sequentially
# Then register MCP tools
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T008)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T009-T012) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T027)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test backlinks independently with sample vault
5. Deploy/demo if ready - users can now discover note connections

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Backlinks) → Test independently → Deploy (MVP! 🎯)
3. Add User Story 2 (Tags) → Test independently → Deploy
4. Add User Story 3 (Insertion) → Test independently → Deploy
5. Add User Story 4 (Statistics) → Test independently → Deploy
6. Polish → Final release

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories!

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 4 developers after Foundational phase completes:
- Developer A: User Story 1 (Backlinks) - T013-T027
- Developer B: User Story 2 (Tags) - T028-T048
- Developer C: User Story 3 (Insertion) - T049-T067
- Developer D: User Story 4 (Statistics) - T068-T088

Stories complete independently and integrate seamlessly.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label (US1-US4) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests MUST fail before implementing (TDD per constitutional requirements)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Run `pytest tests/ --cov=src` frequently to verify 80%+ coverage
- Use MCP Inspector for manual testing: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory $(pwd) run obsidian-mcp`
- Constitutional compliance: PEP 8, type hints, docstrings, error handling, performance targets

**Total Tasks**: 110
**User Story 1**: 15 tasks (T013-T027)
**User Story 2**: 21 tasks (T028-T048)
**User Story 3**: 19 tasks (T049-T067)
**User Story 4**: 21 tasks (T068-T088)
**Setup/Foundation/Polish**: 34 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 35+ tasks marked [P] can run concurrently
**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 only (T001-T027) = 27 tasks for basic backlink functionality
