# Specification Quality Checklist: Extended Obsidian MCP Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality ✅
- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- No mention of Python, SQLite, or specific libraries in the spec itself
- Written from user perspective (Obsidian user working with Claude Code)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness ✅
- All 30 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Success criteria include specific metrics (time, memory, accuracy)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "under 2 seconds" not "database query under 200ms")
- 4 user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios
- 10 edge cases identified
- Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section
- Assumptions and dependencies documented

### Feature Readiness ✅
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and success criteria
- User stories prioritized (P1, P1, P2, P3) and independently testable
- Success criteria include both performance (SC-001 through SC-007) and functional (SC-008 through SC-012) outcomes
- Spec remains implementation-agnostic throughout

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase

The specification successfully:
1. Defines clear user value through 4 prioritized user stories
2. Establishes 30 testable functional requirements
3. Sets 12 measurable success criteria
4. Identifies edge cases and assumptions
5. Maintains technology-agnostic language throughout
6. Provides clear scope boundaries

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan
