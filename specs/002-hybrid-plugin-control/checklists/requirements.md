# Specification Quality Checklist: Hybrid Plugin Control System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**All checklist items PASSED** - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Detailed Validation Results:

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on user value and workflows
- No Python, HTTP, JSON, or other implementation details in requirements
- Written in accessible language for stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- All 60 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- 15 success criteria all include measurable metrics (time, accuracy, counts)
- Success criteria avoid implementation terms (using "users can" not "system implements")
- 10 user stories each have 5 detailed acceptance scenarios (50 total scenarios)
- 12 edge cases identified covering error conditions and boundary cases
- Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries (19 items excluded)
- Assumptions section documents 14 environmental assumptions

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- FR-001 through FR-060 map directly to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories prioritized (P1: Tasks/Dataview metadata, P2: Kanban/Links/Queries, P3: Templates/Workspace/Canvas/Commands)
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-015 provide measurable validation for all major features
- No leaked implementation: "filesystem operations" is acceptable (describes approach), but no mention of specific libraries, APIs, or code structures

**Spec Quality Score**: 100% (All items passed)

**Ready for next phase**: `/speckit.plan` can proceed immediately.
