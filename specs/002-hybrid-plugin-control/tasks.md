# Tasks: Hybrid Plugin Control System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-hybrid-plugin-control/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification. Test tasks are included for quality assurance but can be implemented during or after feature development.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Project uses **single project** structure (MCP server extension):
- Source: `src/` at repository root
- Tests: `tests/` at repository root
- Models: `src/models/obsidian.py`
- Tools: `src/tools/`
- Utils: `src/utils/`

---

- [ ] T014 [P] Update src/server.py to import and register new tool modules (will be populated in user story phases)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-12)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
  - **P1 Stories** (US1, US2): Critical value, implement first
  - **P2 Stories** (US3, US4, US5): High value enhancements
  - **P3 Stories** (US6, US7, US8, US9, US10): Nice-to-have features
- **Graph Analysis (Phase 13)**: Depends on Foundational + US4 (link tracking)
- **Polish (Phase 14)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

**No Dependencies (Can Start After Foundational):**
- User Story 1 (Tasks) - T015-T024
- User Story 2 (Dataview FS) - T025-T034
- User Story 3 (Kanban) - T035-T044
- User Story 5 (Dataview API) - T053-T058
- User Story 6 (Templater API) - T059-T064
- User Story 7 (Templates FS) - T065-T071
- User Story 8 (Workspace) - T072-T079
- User Story 9 (Canvas) - T080-T092
- User Story 10 (Commands) - T093-T099

**Soft Dependency:**
- User Story 4 (Link Tracking) - Should complete before Graph Analysis (Phase 13)
- Graph Analysis - Uses outputs from US4

### Within Each User Story

- All [P] tasks within a story can run in parallel
- Non-[P] tasks may depend on [P] tasks completing first
- Tool registration (last task in each story) depends on all implementations

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Foundational Phase**: T007, T008, T009, T010, T013, T014 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Within User Stories**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Across User Stories**: After Foundational completes, all user stories can progress in parallel
- **Polish Phase**: T107, T108, T110, T112 can run in parallel (different files)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Tasks)

```bash
# After Foundational Phase completes, launch all [P] tasks together:
Task T015: "Create src/tools/tasks.py module..."
Task T016: "Implement format_task_line() function..."
Task T023: "Create tests/unit/test_tasks.py..."

# Then launch sequential tasks:
Task T017: "Implement search_tasks_fs_tool()..." (depends on T015, T016)
Task T018: "Implement create_task_fs_tool()..." (depends on T015, T016)
# ... etc
```

---

## Parallel Example: Cross-Story Parallelization

```bash
# After Foundational Phase completes, all stories can start in parallel:

# Developer 1 (or Agent 1):
User Story 1: T015-T024 (Tasks plugin)

# Developer 2 (or Agent 2):
User Story 2: T025-T034 (Dataview filesystem)

# Developer 3 (or Agent 3):
User Story 3: T035-T044 (Kanban boards)

# All three streams can progress independently and in parallel
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T014) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Tasks (T015-T024)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Dataview FS (T025-T034)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test offline task management and dataview field extraction
6. Deploy/demo MVP

**MVP Scope**: 34 tasks (T001-T034)
**MVP Value**: Complete offline task and metadata management for most popular plugins

### Incremental Delivery (Priority-Based)

1. Foundation: Setup + Foundational (T001-T014) ‚Üí 14 tasks
2. **MVP**: + US1 + US2 (T015-T034) ‚Üí 20 tasks added = 34 total
3. **Enhanced**: + US3 + US4 + US5 (T035-T058) ‚Üí 24 tasks added = 58 total
4. **Full**: + US6-US10 + Graph + Polish (T059-T115) ‚Üí 57 tasks added = 115 total

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundational phase completes:

**Week 1-2**:
- Dev A: User Story 1 (Tasks) + User Story 2 (Dataview FS)
- Dev B: User Story 3 (Kanban) + User Story 4 (Links)
- Dev C: User Story 5 (Dataview API) + User Story 7 (Templates FS)

**Week 3**:
- Dev A: User Story 6 (Templater API) + User Story 8 (Workspace)
- Dev B: User Story 9 (Canvas) + User Story 10 (Commands)
- Dev C: Graph Analysis + Polish

All stories integrate independently.

## Task Statistics

**Total Tasks**: 115

**By Phase**:
- Setup: 5 tasks (T001-T005)
- Foundational: 9 tasks (T006-T014) - **BLOCKS all stories**
- User Story 1 (P1): 10 tasks (T015-T024)
- User Story 2 (P1): 10 tasks (T025-T034)
- User Story 3 (P2): 10 tasks (T035-T044)
- User Story 4 (P2): 8 tasks (T045-T052)
- User Story 5 (P2): 6 tasks (T053-T058)
- User Story 6 (P3): 6 tasks (T059-T064)
- User Story 7 (P3): 7 tasks (T065-T071)
- User Story 8 (P3): 8 tasks (T072-T079)
- User Story 9 (P3): 13 tasks (T080-T092)
- User Story 10 (P3): 7 tasks (T093-T099)
- Graph Analysis: 7 tasks (T100-T106)
- Polish: 9 tasks (T107-T115)

**Parallelizable Tasks**: 42 tasks marked [P] (36% can run in parallel)

**Critical Path** (shortest path to MVP):
1. Setup (5 tasks)
2. Foundational (9 tasks) - **Must complete serially due to dependencies**
3. US1 implementation (10 tasks - some parallel)
4. US2 implementation (10 tasks - some parallel)
**Total**: ~34 tasks for MVP

**Estimated Effort**:
- MVP (US1+US2): 2-3 weeks
- Enhanced (US1-US5): 4-5 weeks
- Full (US1-US10 + Graph + Polish): 6-7 weeks

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [US#] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- MVP scope (US1+US2) delivers maximum value for offline workflows
- All filesystem tools work without Obsidian running (constitutional compliance)
- All API tools gracefully degrade with clear error messages when Obsidian unavailable
- Performance targets validated in research.md for all operations
